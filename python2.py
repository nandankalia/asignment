# # 16. Write a Python program to get the difference between a given number and 17, if the number is greater than 17 return double the absolute difference.

# # a = int(input("enter a number: "))
# # if a < 17:
# #     print("difference is: ",17-a)
# # else:
# #     b = a-17
# #     c = abs(b)
# #     print("given number ia greater than 17 hence double of its absoulte difference is " , 2*c)

# #17. Write a Python program to test whether a number is within 100 of 1000 or 2000. 

# # a = int(input("enter the number : "))
# # if (a >= 900 and a <= 1100):
# #     print("given number is with in 100 of 1000")

# # else:
# #     print("given is not with in 100 of 1000  or 2000")    

# 18. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return three times of their sum

# a = float(input("enter a number :"))
# b = float(input("enter a number :"))
# c = float(input("enter a number :"))

# if (a==b and b==c):
#     d = a+b+c
#     print(d*3)
# else:
#     print (a+b+c)

#19. Write a Python program to get a new string from a given string where "Is" has been added to the front. If the given string already begins with "Is" then return the string unchanged.

# string = str(input("Enter a string : "))
# if (len(string) >=2 and string[:2] == 'Is'):
#     print(string)
# else:
#     print("Is"+string)
